[Current Program](https://catalog.oaklandcc.edu/programs/computer-information-systems/software-engineering-option-aas/)
  
[Course Descriptions](https://catalog.oaklandcc.edu/course-descriptions/cis/)

## Change highlights:
- Add 3 focus areas, 2 that align with the CIS.SWE.CT programs, and 1 that aligns with the CIS.DSC.CT
- Remove 1300 Networking, 1500 Intro to programming in java, 2111 Systems Analysis and Design from core courses
- Remove 1420 HTML and add content to revamped 1440 Front End Web course
- Add Python as required programming course as it's a pre-req to later advanced courses
- Add option of 2nd language instead of requiring C++ ( this helps align with certificates as well )
- Update 2454 web systems development to be a full stack web development course
- Update 2858 Web Services and Integration to Cloud Native Systems and Integration
- Add new Practical AI course to advanced course courses ( 2131 prereq )
- Update game design focus with Graphics modeling software (e.g., Blender) instead of CAD course
- Add CIS 2991 as Capstone course to align with CT program
