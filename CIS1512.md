# CIS 1512 - Principles of Software Engineering   

## Course Description
This course is focused on formal methods and approaches used in the design, development, testing and maintenance of computer software. Each stage of the software development life cycle (SDLC) will be studied in detail. Topics such as low-level design, high-level design, modeling with UML (Unified Modeling Language), iterative development models, rapid application development (RAD), formal testing methods, incremental deployment, formal metrics, as well as appropriate use of associated tools will be covered with practical applications. Students will be required to complete computer-based assignments inside/outside of class.

## Corequisite
