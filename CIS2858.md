# CIS 2858 - Cloud Native Systems and Integration

## Course Description
This course focuses on design and implementation strategies for Cloud-native architecture and technologies which are an approach to designing, constructing, and operating workloads that are built in the cloud and take full advantage of the cloud computing model. Topics to be covered will include: Web middleware-related technologies, multi-tier application frameworks; Extensible Markup Language (XML) processing; Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP); Representational State Transfer (RESTful) Web services; Web Services Description Language (WSDL); and Cloud Computing services.
